The main research interest of Dr. Weiâ€™s Lab is to fundamentally address the needs and challenges for scalable fabrication processes to produce flexible devices down to the nanometer-scale. The core technique is so-called preform-to-fiber fabrication by thermally drawing a macroscopic solid-state preform into extended lengths of uniform fibers. This allows the fabrication of novel devices with unprecedented control over architecture, composition, and functionality on the extended fiber length scales from nanometer to kilometer range. The resulting fibers play a leading role in development of multidisciplinary solutions for fiber-based optoelectronic devices, fiber-based wearable electronics, multi-functional fibers, bio-fiber interfaces, and in-fiber energy generation and storage in both single flexible fiber and multi-dimensional fabrics.
